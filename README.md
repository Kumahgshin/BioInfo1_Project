## BioInfo1 course Final Project
### Make Figure 5A Plot (GO analysis)
![Figure_5A](https://github.com/Kumahgshin/BioInfo1_Project/assets/125420516/5d800049-e921-46e7-8b95-5b93e690648c)

Performing gene ontology (GO) analysis to understand
functional consequences of LIN28A-mediated translational control (Figure 5A). This analysis revealed strong enrichment of
several terms, with most biased GO terms related to cellular
components.


Enrichment level and Ribosome density are same as in practice 1 result.
The circle size represents number of genes, and color is P-value. 
Using UniProt Id for GO analysis, and FDR <0.05 subset terms were omitted.
Two GO analysis is conducted, One is CLIP-seq(C) and the other is ribosome footprinting data(R).
The circle color..?? Using mean of P-values?
